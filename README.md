# Last.Fm-Now-Playing-Widget
A widget to be placed on web pages to display the currently playing last.fm track within a static frame.

# Usage
widget.html contains an example of how this would be embedded into a web page. This contains all necessary CSS, JavaScript and HTML. Obviously other elements can be on the page but this is a stripped down example of how I use this. 

The php is coded badly. I know.
